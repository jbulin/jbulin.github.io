# About me

> I am an Assistant Professor at the [Department of Theoretical Computer Science and Mathematical Logic ("KTIML")](https://www.ktiml.mff.cuni.cz/KTIML-1.html), [Faculty of Mathematics and Physics](https://www.mff.cuni.cz/) of the [Charles University](https://cuni.cz/UK-1.html) in Prague, Czechia.

I am one of the logicians in [this picture](files/me.jpg).

### Theses and projects

I can offer theses in theoretical computer science as well as several research software projects. Informal inquiries are most welcome!

# Research

> My primary research interests lie in the intersection of theoretical computer science, computational logic, and universal algebra. A majority of my work is concerned with the complexity of the constraint satisfaction problem. I am also interested in constraint modeling, automated theorem proving, and artificial intelligence.
