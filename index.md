### Theses and projects

I can offer theses in theoretical computer science as well as several research software projects. Informal inquiries are most welcome!


# Research

> My primary research interests lie in the intersection of theoretical computer science, computational logic, and universal algebra. A majority of my work is concerned with the complexity of the constraint satisfaction problem. I am also interested in constraint modeling, automated theorem proving, and artificial intelligence.
