# Theses and student projects

I am currently looking for at least two new bachelor students and at least one master student. Get in touch to discuss more!

## Bachelor theses

Suitable in particular for specializations General computer science and Artificial Intelligence. I prefer topics in or adjacent to the following areas:

* constraint satisfaction
* computational logic
* descriptive complexity
* discrete optimization

You are however most welcome to bring your own topic, I am open to new areas as long as I feel I will be able to provide meaningful supervision.

## Software projects

Some of the topics are suitable for a software project as well. Typically, but not necessarily, the software you would be implementing would be of experimental and/or theoretical flavor.

## Master theses

Also preferably related to some of the above areas, or my reserach. We can tailor the topic to fit both our interests.

Informal inquiries are most welcome!
