## Credit requirements

There will be 12 homework assignments each of which is worth 1 point. In order to get the credit, you must gain at least 6 points, out of which at least 3 points must be from the second half of the semester (assignments 7-). Expect increasing complexity of the assignments as the semester progresses. There will be an additional option to get at most 3 points after the end of classes for solving substantially harder problems.
