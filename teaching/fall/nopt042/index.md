## Tutorial schedule

### Before the first tutorial

* Install Picat and try it out. (See [Getting started with Picat](http://picat-lang.org/download/get_started.pdf).)
* Solve the [test assignment](https://classroom.github.com/a/1ZJRMLa6). Push your solution to the repo, and check if it passed the tests.

### 1st tutorial

* **Program:** Overview of Picat.
* **Homework:** [leaves](https://classroom.github.com/a/SR6S7hUf)

### 2nd tutorial

* **Program:** Intro to CP.
* **Homework:** [crypt-arithmetic](https://classroom.github.com/a/vu6gMI8t)

## Credit requirements

There will be 12 homework assignments each of which is worth 1 point. In order to get the credit, you must gain at least 8 points, out of which at least 4 points must be from the second half of the semester (assignments 7-). Expect increasing complexity of the assignments as the semester progresses. There will be an additional option to get at most 4 points after the end of classes for solving somewhat harder problems.

The solutions to the homework assignments must be 100% your own work. Do not discuss them with anyone but me, do not search for solutions on the internet, and do not share your code.

## Frequently asked questions (FAQ)

* _What should I do if I have a question?_ --- Check the FAQ. If you don't see the answer here email me putting "nopt042" in the subject.
* _What if I want a consultation?_ --- Talk to me after class, come to the scheduled office hours, or email me to arrange an appointment.
