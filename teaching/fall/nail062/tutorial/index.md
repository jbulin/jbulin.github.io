# NAIL062 Propositional and predicate logic: tutorial (Fall 2025)

Here you will find information about the English tutorial class taught by me.

## Office hours during the teaching period

<span style="color:red">**Oct 9: Today's office hours are postponed from 2pm to 5:15pm**</span>

* Monday 10:40am in S303  
* Monday 3:30pm (after the lecture) in front of N1  
* Thursday 2:00pm in S303 (on Nov 20 cancelled due to a workshop) 

or make an appointment (via email); two additional hours per week will be available.

## Credit requirements

During the semester, there will be two written tests (45 minutes each). The first (roughly in the middle of the semester) will cover _"Propositional Logic"_, and the second (towards the end of the semester) will cover _"Predicate Logic"_. Each test is worth a maximum of 100 points. You will have one retake attempt for each test. No further retake opportunities will be provided.

In addition to the tests, up to 50 points can be earned from homework:

* 40 points for the SAT solver application project  
* 5 points for propositional logic homework  
* 5 points for predicate logic homework  

Communication with anyone other than the instructor about the assignments is prohibited until the submission deadline. It is also not permitted to use generative AI tools when working on the assignment. Solutions must be 100% your own work, and it is your responsibility to ensure that no one else has access to your solution.

> To pass the course, you must earn at least **140 points in total**, and at the same time at least **40 points from each test**.

## The written tests

* Propositional logic test date: **Nov 20** [Sample test: Propositional Logic](https://github.com/jbulin-mff-uk/nail062/raw/main/tutorial/sample-tests/sample-test-propositional-logic.pdf)  
* Predicate logic test date: **Jan 8** [Sample test: Predicate Logic](https://github.com/jbulin-mff-uk/nail062/raw/main/tutorial/sample-tests/sample-test-predicate-logic.pdf)  
* Preliminary retake dates (for both tests): during the first week of the exam period (will be specified depending on the number of students who will not have passed)

## Homework

* Propositional logic homework: due **Nov 13** at the beginning of class. Task: solve the [Sample test for propositional logic](https://github.com/jbulin-mff-uk/nail062/raw/main/tutorial/sample-tests/sample-test-propositional-logic.pdf) (Submit on paper or in the SIS Module Study Group Roster as a single PDF file with white background.)  
* Predicate logic homework: due **Dec 18** at the start of the exercise session. Task: solve the [Sample test for predicate logic](https://github.com/jbulin-mff-uk/nail062/raw/main/tutorial/sample-tests/sample-test-predicate-logic.pdf) (Submit on paper or in the SIS Module Study Group Roster as a single PDF file with white background. Part (c) of the first problem will not be graded, as we likely will not have enough time to practice it. However, it is recommended to try solving it.)
* SAT solver application project: [detailed assignment](https://jbulin.github.io/teaching/fall/nail062/tutorial/sat-project-english.html), **by Oct 20** submit your preferences and suggestions for problems, **by end of November** submit the finished project
